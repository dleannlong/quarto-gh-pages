    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nPublic health research often concerns relationships between exposures and correlated count outcomes. When counts exhibit more 0s than expected under Poisson sampling, the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model with random effects may be used. However, the latent class formulation of the ZIP model can make marginal inference on the population sampled challenging. The paper presents a marginalized ZIP model with random effects to model directly the mean of the mixture distribution consisting of â€˜susceptibleâ€™ individuals and excess 0s, providing straightforward inference for overall exposure effects. Simulations evaluate finite sample properties, and the new methods are applied to a motivational interviewing-based safer sex intervention trial, designed to reduce the number of unprotected sexual acts, to illustrate the new methods."

    "text": "Research\nMy research interests center around marginalized zero-inflated count regression models and their applications to public health. My dissertation specifically examined marginalized zero-inflated Poisson regression. My expertise in this area has led to applications of these models to dental caries indices, which are characterized by a high prevalence of zero counts, and to investigate the influence of overall exposure effects within these models. As a co-investigator and lead statistician on various research projects, I have contributed to a wide array of public health studies. These studies have addressed critical issues such as adolescent transportation safety, stroke care delivery, social determinants of health that impact diabetes and hypertension, neurological disorders, chronic low back pain, firearms safety, and youth soccer injury prevention. My work has also explored the effects of cell phone laws on young drivers, prescription drug overdose prevention, and neonatal abstinence syndrome. With over 60 publications in peer-reviewed journals, I have significantly advanced public health research, with work appearing in prominent journals like the American Journal of Epidemiology, Diabetes Care, Neurology, and Hypertension."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\nPurpose\nRelative to White adults, Black adults have a substantially higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, both key risk factors for stroke, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Blood biomarkers have shown promise in identifying contributors to racial disparities in many chronic diseases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe outline the study design and related statistical considerations for a nested cohort study, the Biomarker Mediators of Racial Disparities in Risk Factors (BioMedioR) study, within the 30,239-person biracial REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study (2003-present). Selected biomarkers will be assessed for contributions to racial disparities in risk factor development over median 9.4 years of follow-up, with initial focus on hypertension, and diabetes. Here we outline study design decisions and statistical considerations for the sampling of 4,400 BioMedioR participants.\n\n\nResults\nThe population for biomarker assessment was selected using a random sample study design balanced across race and sex to provide the optimal opportunity to describe association of biomarkers with the development of hypertension and diabetes. Descriptive characteristics of the BioMedioR sample and analytic plans are provided for this nested cohort study.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis nested biomarker study will examine pathways with the target to help explain racial differences in hypertension and diabetes incidence."

    "title": "A Marginalized Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression Model with Overall Exposure Effects",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model is often employed in public health research to examine the relationships between exposures of interest and a count outcome exhibiting many zeros, in excess of the amount expected under sampling from a Poisson distribution. The regression coefficients of the ZIP model have latent class interpretations, which correspond to a susceptible subpopulation at risk for the condition with counts generated from a Poisson distribution and a non-susceptible subpopulation that provide the extra or excess zeros. The ZIP model parameters, however, are not well suited for inference targeted at marginal means, specifically, in quantifying the effect of an explanatory variable in the overall mixture population. We develop a marginalized ZIP model approach for independent responses to model the population mean count directly, allowing straightforward inference for overall exposure effects and empirical robust variance estimation for overall log incidence density ratios. Through simulation studies, the performance of maximum likelihood estimation of the marginalized ZIP model is assessed and compared to other methods of estimating overall exposure effects. The marginalized ZIP model is applied to a recent study of a motivational interviewing-based safer sex counseling intervention, designed to reduce unprotected sexual act counts."
